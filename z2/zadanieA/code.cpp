//This program is an extension of setSimple
//We're working with the assumption that every element in the set can be labeled with a number from range [1, N] or a character
//The program contains implementation of functions such that following links are formed:
    //1. intigers such that n, n+1, n+2, ..., m given n < m
    //2. intigers such that n, n+2, c+4, ..., m given n < m
    //3. characters a, b, c, d, e, ..., z
    //4. 2 char strings, created form all characters from a, b, c, d, e, ..., z
